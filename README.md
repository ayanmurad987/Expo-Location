Hi [Developer Name],

I've successfully created the PayPal application for Expert Marine Records.

Here are the details:

Environment: Sandbox (for testing)

Please let me know when you've integrated this and when I can test the payment system.

Thanks!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

### üîí Keep Your Client ID Safe
- **Client ID** is safe to share with your developer
- **Secret Key** should NEVER be shared (keep it private)
- Only share the Client ID, not the Secret

### üß™ Testing vs Live
- **Sandbox Client ID** = For testing only (no real money)
- **Live Client ID** = For real payments (get this later)

---

## üîÑ Step 5: When Ready for Live Payments

### Later, when your website is ready:

1. **Go back to PayPal Developer Dashboard**
2. **Switch from "Sandbox" to "Live"**
3. **Create a new app** (same process as above)
4. **Get the Live Client ID**
5. **Send the Live Client ID to your developer**
